# Network-Visualization-Project
A network of US airports and the flights between them. FlightGraph.pdf is the network mapped over a map of the United States. The network visualization was processed in Gephi.

<b>Supporting files:
edgesFlights.tsv - edges of network
nodesFlights.csv - nodes of network (after script was run)
Airport_Codes.csv - set of airport codes mapped to their coordinates

<b>Script:
airportCodes.py - edits the nodesFlights.csv contents (originally only containing id and name columns) to add latitude and longitude.
